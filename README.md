# Donders-IV-code-portfolio
This temporary repository shows two sample files of a Python pipeline that takes external neuroimaging data and performs analysis.

informative_variance_grid_bash.sh feeds the participant data to the backend in a distributed way.
grid_cci_publ.py feeds the data of one participant and one session to the analysis pipeline.
cci_functions_publ.py performs one analysis.

The code is taken from the Informative Variance project for MEG-analysis in the Kietzmann lab, and I independently wrote all code. It is now used for analyses in preparation for a publication. For completeness, I have added the .bash file that provides the external input. This file was written by Philip Sulewski and myself.
