# Donders-IV-code-portfolio
This temporary repository shows sample files of a Python pipeline that takes external neuroimaging data and performs analysis.
The code is taken from the Informative Variance project in the Kietzmann lab, and I independently wrote the code. It is now used for analyses in preparation for a publication.
