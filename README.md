# Donders-IV-code-portfolio
This temporary repository shows two sample files of a Python pipeline that takes external neuroimaging data and performs analysis.
The code is taken from the Informative Variance project in the Kietzmann lab, and I independently wrote all code. It is now used for analyses in preparation for a publication.
For completeness, I have added the .bash file that provides the external input. This file was written by Philip Sulewski and myself.
